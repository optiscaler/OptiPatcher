> [!NOTE]
> ### Special notes
> * Robocop Rogue City and Unfinished Business DLSS plugin is patched, but due to extra checks when not spoofing, to expose DLSS/DLSS-FG properly, requires setting `UpscalingMethod=2` in **GameUserSettings.ini** in `AppData\Local\RoboCop\Saved\Config\Windows` (also maybe `NvidiaReflexLowLatency=1` if it isn't exposed already) - for Robocop Unfinished Business `AppData\Local\RoboCopUnfinishedBusiness\Saved\Config\Windows`  
> * To get XeFG 2.1 for non-Intel GPUs, just replace the XeSS files in `Robocop Rogue City\Engine\Plugins\Runtime\Intel\XeSS\Binaries\ThirdParty\Win64`
